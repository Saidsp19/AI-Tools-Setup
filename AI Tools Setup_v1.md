### Step 10: Start Using the AWS Free Tier

45.  **Explore AWS Services:** Browse the AWS Management Console to explore the different AWS services available.

46.  **Check Free Tier Eligibility:** When using a service, always check its Free Tier eligibility to ensure you stay within the free usage limits. Refer to the AWS Free Tier documentation for details on the services and their respective limits.

47.  **Monitor Your Usage:** Regularly monitor your AWS usage to avoid unexpected charges. You can use the AWS Cost Management console for this purpose.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Security:** Protect your AWS account credentials (email address and password). Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
*   **Free Tier Limits:** Be aware of the Free Tier limits for each service. Exceeding these limits will result in charges to your account.
*   **Account Region:** Choose the AWS region closest to your location (e.g., Mumbai) for lower latency and better performance.  However, Free Tier availability can vary by region, so confirm the availability of the services you intend to use in your chosen region.
*   **Clean Up Resources:** When you're finished experimenting with a service, remember to delete or terminate any resources you created to avoid incurring charges.
